# Antares Bot

- Description: Antares Bot is a small Discord bot with a lot of fun commands and features. It is built on top of [Discord.Js V13.1.0](https://discord.js.org/) and [WOKCommands](https://github.com/AlexzanderFlores/WOKCommands)

## How to run yourself

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Refer to [this file](/.env-example) for an example.
- git clone <https://github.com/Antares-Network/AntaresBot.git>
- cd AntaresBot
- npm install
- npm install -g typescript ts-node
- ts-node index.ts
- Note: You may have to wait up to an hour for discord to register slash commands in all guilds.

## End goal of the project

- This project is really just for fun and to test my (Nate's) skills at JavaScript and TypeScript and many other technologies. I will consider myself to have made it when the official Antares Bot gets verified by Discord.


- This bot can be used with heroku, but it is not recommended. A procfile is included in this repository as it is required for heroku use.
